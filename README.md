#      **Treeshake-bash-command**

## _this is a custom bash script/command that I created to avoid the redundant process of always having to type apt-get update followed by apt-get upgrade on your system before every install._

### this project includes
* Linux or Git bash
* A little bit of patience!


### Synopsis
this script is the equivalent of running three redundant commands.... sudo apt-get update, sudo apt-get upgrade and sudo apt-get auto-clean. I use it before every install to avoid problems and I thought it would be easier to just type one command instead of three.


### Code Review
nothing to review. 3 commands bota boom bota bing.

### final thought
#### this works really well for me, the only thing worth considering is the fact that sometimes the updates and treeshaking can take a bit longer than you want. otherwise shake it like a tail feather!!!!!
