# Treeshake-bash-command
this is a custom bash script/command that I created to avoid the redundant process of always having to type apt-get update followed by apt-get upgrade on your system before every install. 

to use this command simply type treeshake and you will be prompted for your command. after typing your command, the system will update the package lists and upgrade your system. Finally your software can be installed clean and cool.
